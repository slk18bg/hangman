# hangman
 game of hangman

Play as you would a normal game of hangman.

Attempted to connect to an API with fetch to grab random words and hints for the words, but that was causing problems so I went with local data for this version. Planning to make the game functional with an API later.

Also not happy with the code organization for the first version. I plan to modify that in later versions as well.

Ignore the game2.js file, this contains some previous approaches I attempted, including the fetch call I attempted to implement.

(Characters from the Bleach anime by Kubo Tite)
You might see "Byakuya" and "Wakame" be used in some places, and "Captain Kuchiki" and "Ambassador Seaweed" in other places. "Byakuya" is Captain Kuchiki's first name, and "Wakame" is the Japanese name for "Ambassador Seaweed".

The lore is that Captain Kuchiki created a goofy sand sculpture, which was Ambassador Seaweed, for a sand sculpting competition and he thinks highly of the design while others all think it looks weird.
